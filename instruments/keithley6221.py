"""
Keithley 6221 DC Current Source — shared connect/shutdown/acquisition helpers
===============================================================================
Author: Joacim Stenlund <joacim.stenlund@physics.uu.se>
Created: 2026-08-06

The 6221 driver itself ships with pymeasure (pymeasure.instruments.keithley.
Keithley6221) — this module holds the connect/shutdown/acquisition wrapper
functions shared by the DC measurement programs.

Usage example (fixed sense-current case):
    from instruments.keithley6221 import SourceConfig, connect_source, shutdown_source

    src_cfg = SourceConfig(visa_resource="GPIB0::12::INSTR", sense_current_A=1e-3)
    source = connect_source(src_cfg)
    ...
    shutdown_source(source)

A program that instead sweeps the current itself (dc_iv_curve.py) keeps its
own SourceConfig shape (a sweep range, not a fixed sense current) and calls
the lower-level `connect()` directly with an explicit `initial_current_A`.
